# Basic_Classification_Models_Analysis
An introduction to using machine learning algorithms as classifiers in cojunction with feature selection and model tuning

The following notebook performs classification analysis using a variety of machine learning algorithms.The algorithms are trained using known income levels and personal characteristics of a population. After som data cleaning and exploration, a subset of features are extracted and used as the predictors in four different machine learning algorithms. The models are used to predict the income bracket of a person based on input characteristics.

The purpose is to explore the accuracy of various models and to perform tuning of the models to improve their accuracy.

Feature engineering is useful to machine learning by reducing the computational load of the algorithms by reducing the number of features required to include in the set. The important aspect of feature engineering is to reduce the number of features while maintaining the essence of correlation between the feautures and the target and to include only the features which explain the variance in the target set. When data sets become very large and include a large number of variables then feature engineering becomes much more critical in order to have the algorithms compute as efficiently as possible.
